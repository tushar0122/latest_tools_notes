ThreadPool 
    => A Thread pool is simply a collection of pre-initialized or worker threads at the start-up that can be used to execute tasks and put back in the pool when completed. It is referred to as pool threads in which a group of fixed-size threads is created.  By reducing the number of application threads and managing their lifecycle, one can mitigate the issue of performance using a thread pool. Using threads, performance can be enhanced and better system stability can occur. To create the thread pools, java.util.concurrent.Executors class usually provides factory methods.
